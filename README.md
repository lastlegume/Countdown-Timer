An extension that counts down until a certain date and time. Simply click on the icon on your addons taskbar, enter a date, and watch as the extension counts down until the start of that day. The icon represents the time elapsed since the start of the countdown in a simple pie chart. You can add as many dates as you want and choose between all of them. Timers are deleted one hour after they finish to reduce clutter.
